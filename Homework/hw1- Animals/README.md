# Animals
### HW1 from the Computer Software Architecture course

## Variant
My given number was 292, which therefore resulted in me doing taks #12
Animals and sorting the elements by #21 - delete those elements, which
have a special number less than the average special number of all
elements in the container. The remaining elements move to the beginning
of the container.
